# Report Writer
This markdown file is an instructional guide on how to install and use the Report Writer.

## Installing 

#### 1. Creating the right folders
  
  1. Press the magnifying glass icon in the top right hand corner of the screen and type in `terminal` and press Enter. 
   
  2. Your Terminal should now be open. And should have written on the last line something along the lines of: 
  `Honigs-MacBook-Air:~ honigschnitzel$` Don't worry if it does not have exactly this written on it. The important thing 
  is that it has `~` (This is your current directory, which is your home directory, i.e. where you start when you first
  open a Terminal) and `$` (This is the symbol that usually precedes an instruction to the computer)in the right places.
   Let's go ahead and pin the Terminal to your dock so that you don't have to keep searching for it to open it. 
  Right click on your open Terminal in the dock and go to `Options` and click `Keep in Dock` like in the image below:

   "Adding Terminal to the Dock")
  
  3. Let's now check that we are in the right place. Into your terminal let's type in `pwd` (which stands for "present 
  working directory") after the dollar sign and 
  press Enter. You should get something that looks like this:

        ```bash
        Honigs-MacBook-Air:~ honigschnitzel$ pwd
        /Users/honigschnitzel
        ```
     For future reference from here on in I will write all of the code that you should enter into the terminal after a 
     dollar sign and the expected result on the line below. Thus, the previous instruction and result would appear like this:
     
        ```bash
        $ pwd
        /Users/honigschnitzel
        ```
      But there is no need to type the dollar sign, it merely signifies code to type in. :)
