# Report Writer
This markdown file is an instructional guide on how to install and use the Report Writer.

## Installing 

#### 1. Creating the right folders
  
  1. Press the magnifying glass icon in the top right hand corner of the screen and type in `terminal` and press Enter. 
   
  2. Your Terminal should now be open. And should have written on the last line something along the lines of: 
  `Beths-MacBook-Air:~ betharchibald$` Don't worry if it doesn't have exactly this written on it. The important thing 
  is that it has `~` (This is your current directory, which is your home directory, i.e. where you start when you first
  open a Terminal) and `$` (This is the symbol that usually precedes an instruction to the computer)in the right places.
   Let's go ahead and pin the Terminal to your dock so that you don't have to keep searching for it to open it. 
  Right click on your open Terminal in the dock and go to `Options` and click `Keep in Dock` like in the image below:
